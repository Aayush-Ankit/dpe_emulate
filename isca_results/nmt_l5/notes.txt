1. Increased tile_instrn_memory size to 1024 entries to fit all instructions
2. Increased datamemory size to 1024 entries to cope with register allocation in compiler
3. Note these numbers will be multiplied by sequence size for time and energy
4. Inter-node transfers are buffered (to avoid having multiple inter-node transfers of same data across multiple utput neurons)
